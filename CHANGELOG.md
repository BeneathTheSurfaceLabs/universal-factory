# Changelog

All notable changes to `universal-factory` will be documented in this file.

## v.1.1.0-beta - 2024-09-26

This release adds the ability to configure a custom method name for the universal factory.

In its previous state, this package was not able to be used when your source class already has a method named `factory()`.
